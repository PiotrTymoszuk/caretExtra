Tools for quality control, prediction and plotting for caret models

Includes a bunch of methods for user friendly extraction of the predictions in the train, cross-validation and test data, fit statistic calulation, diagnostic via residuals plots and graphical representation of the results as point, ROC and heat map plots. Currently, it works only with cross-validated Caret models (CV or repreated CV) created from formula objects. Solution for bootstrap and holdout model construction methods are on the way.
