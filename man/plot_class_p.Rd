a list of ggplot graphics: one plot for squared distances
(\code{square_dist}) and one plot for class assignment probabilities (\code{winner_p}).
}
\description{
\code{plot_class_p}: This internally used function plots squared distances
to the outcome (as defined by Brier at al.) and class-assignment
probabilities for the outcome classes as scatter plots.
The correct/false class assignment is color-coded.
The observations are sorted by the statistic value.
Numbers of complete observations are indicated in the plot subtitle
(if not provided by the user) and class n numbers can be displayed in
the plot facets (\code{show_class_n} set to TRUE).

\code{plot_class_stats}: The function plots squared distances
to the outcome (as defined by Brier at al.) and class-assignment
probabilities for the outcome classes as box plots. Class n numbers are
indicated in the X axis.
}
\details{
For regression, NULL and a warning is returned.
